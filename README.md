## :mag_right: Documentation

The documentation for this project uses the [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) generator tool to maintain code legibility, inform about technical specifications and clarify module relationships. The tool achieves this by extracting information from specially-formatted comments within the code, with which it hierarchizes code structure. Cross referencing is also possible, so the reader may easily refer to the code from the documentation and vice-versa.
