## :mag_right: Documentation

The documentation for this project uses the [*doxygen*](https://www.doxygen.nl/) generator tool to maintain code legibility, inform about technical specifications and clarify module relationships. The tool achieves this by extracting information from specially-formatted comments within the code, with which it hierarchizes code structure. Cross referencing is also possible, so the reader may easily refer to the code from the documentation and vice-versa.

    The start of a file should include a header with appropriate information regarding its author, brief description and associated license at least. Other sections found pertinent may also be added.
  
  ### C++
  ```cpp
  /**
   * @file

   * @version 1.0
   * @brief Example C++ program with Doxygen style comments.
   *
   * @section LICENSE

  ### Python

  # @file doxygen_example.py
  # @author John Doe <jdoe@example.com>
  # @brief Example Python program with Doxygen style comments.

  Subsequentely, *doxygen* syntax encompasses markup of data structures and code modules specifying the purpose of the entity, associated parameters and any possible values to be passed on in return.
  
  ### C++
  ```cpp
  /**
   * <A short one line description>
   *
   * <Longer description which may span multiple lines or paragraphs as needed>

   * @param  ...
   *
   * @return Description of the return value
   */
  ```
